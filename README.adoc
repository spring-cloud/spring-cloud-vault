Spring Cloud Vault Config provides client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system.
With https://www.vaultproject.io[HashiCorp's Vault] you have a central place to manage external secret properties for applications across all environments.
Vault can manage static and dynamic secrets such as username/password for remote applications/resources and provide credentials for external services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, Couchbase, MongoDB, Consul, AWS and more.

== Features

=== Spring Cloud Vault Config Client

Specifically for Spring applications:

* Retrieve secrets from Vault and initialize Spring Environment with remote property sources.
* Obtain {docs}#vault.config.backends.kv[Key-Value secrets] secured with SSL.
* Generate credentials for
{docs}#vault.config.backends.mysql[MySQL],
{docs}#vault.config.backends.postgresql[PostgreSQL],
{docs}#vault.config.backends.cassandra[Apache Cassandra],
{docs}#vault.config.backends.mongodb[MongoDB],
{docs}#vault.config.backends.consul[Consul],
{docs}#vault.config.backends.aws[AWS], and {docs}#vault.config.backends.rabbitmq[RabbitMQ].
* {docs}#vault.config.authentication.token[Token],
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.appid[AppId],
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.approle[AppRole],
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.clientcert[Client Certificate],
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.cubbyhole[Cubbyhole],
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.awsec2[AWS-EC2] authentication,
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.awsiam[AWS-IAM] authentication, and
{docs}#vault.config.authentication.kubernetes[Kubernetes] authentication.

* Bootstrap application context: a parent context for the main application that can be trained to do anything.

== Quick Start

:docs: https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/reference/html/

*Prerequisites*

To get started with Vault and this guide you need a *NIX-like operating systems that provides:

* `wget`, `openssl` and `unzip`
* at least Java 8 and a properly configured `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

NOTE: This guide explains Vault setup from a Spring Cloud Vault perspective for integration testing.
You can find a getting started guide directly on the Vault project site: https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault

*Install Vault*

[source,bash]
----
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/${vault_version}/vault_${vault_version}_${platform}.zip
$ unzip vault_${vault_version}_${platform}.zip
----

NOTE: These steps can be achieved by downloading and running https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-vault/blob/master/src/test/bash/install_vault.sh[`install_vault.sh`].

*Create SSL certificates for Vault*

Next, you'r required to generate a set of certificates:

* Root CA
* Vault Certificate (decrypted key `work/ca/private/localhost.decrypted.key.pem` and certificate `work/ca/certs/localhost.cert.pem`)

Make sure to import the Root Certificate into a Java-compliant truststore.

The easiest way to achieve this is by using OpenSSL.

NOTE: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-vault/blob/master/src/test/bash/[`create_certificates.sh`] creates certificates in `work/ca` and a JKS truststore `work/keystore.jks`.
If you want to run Spring Cloud Vault using this quickstart guide you need to configure the truststore the `spring.cloud.vault.ssl.trust-store` property to `file:work/keystore.jks`.

[[quickstart.vault.start]]
*Start Vault server*

Next create a config file along the lines of:

[source]
----
backend "inmem" {
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_cert_file = "work/ca/certs/localhost.cert.pem"
  tls_key_file = "work/ca/private/localhost.decrypted.key.pem"
}

disable_mlock = true
----

NOTE: You can find an example config file at  https://github.com/spring-clod/spring-cloud-vault/blob/master/src/test/bash/vault.conf[`vault.conf`].

[source,bash]
----
$ vault server -config=vault.conf
----

Vault is started listening on `0.0.0.0:8200` using the `inmem` storage and `https`.
Vault is sealed and not initialized when starting up.

NOTE: If you want to run tests, leave Vault uninitialized.
The tests will initialize Vault and create a root token `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

If you want to use Vault for your application or give it a try then you need to initialize it first.

[source,bash]
----
$ export VAULT_ADDR="https://localhost:8200"
$ export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true # Don't do this for production
$ vault operator init
----

You should see something like:

[source,bash]
----
Key 1: 7149c6a2e16b8833f6eb1e76df03e47f6113a3288b3093faf5033d44f0e70fe701
Key 2: 901c534c7988c18c20435a85213c683bdcf0efcd82e38e2893779f152978c18c02
Key 3: 03ff3948575b1165a20c20ee7c3e6edf04f4cdbe0e82dbff5be49c63f98bc03a03
Key 4: 216ae5cc3ddaf93ceb8e1d15bb9fc3176653f5b738f5f3d1ee00cd7dccbe926e04
Key 5: b2898fc8130929d569c1677ee69dc5f3be57d7c4b494a6062693ce0b1c4d93d805
Initial Root Token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76

Vault initialized with 5 keys and a key threshold of 3. Please
securely distribute the above keys. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must provide at least 3 of these keys
to unseal it again.

Vault does not store the master key. Without at least 3 keys,
your Vault will remain permanently sealed.
----

Vault will initialize and return a set of unsealing keys and the root token.
Pick 3 keys and unseal Vault.
Store the Vault token in the `VAULT_TOKEN`
environment variable.

[source,bash]
----
$ vault operator unseal (Key 1)
$ vault operator unseal (Key 2)
$ vault operator unseal (Key 3)
$ export VAULT_TOKEN=(Root token)
# Required to run Spring Cloud Vault tests after manual initialization
$ vault token create -id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -policy="root"
----

Spring Cloud Vault accesses different resources.
By default, the secret backend is enabled which accesses secret config settings via JSON endpoints.

The HTTP service has resources in the form:

----
/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{defaultContext}/{profile}
/secret/{defaultContext}
----

where the "application" is injected as the `spring.application.name` in the
`SpringApplication` (i.e. what is normally "application" in a regular Spring Boot app), "profile" is an active profile (or comma-separated list of properties).
Properties retrieved from Vault will be used "as-is" without further prefixing of the property names.

== Client Side Usage

To use these features in an application, just build it as a Spring Boot application that depends on `spring-cloud-vault-config` (e.g. see the test cases).
Example Maven configuration:

.pom.xml
====
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.0.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath /> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-vault-config</artifactId>
        <version>{project-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

<!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones -->
----
====

Then you can create a standard Spring Boot application, like this simple HTTP server:

====
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----
====

When it runs it will pick up the external configuration from the default local Vault server on port `8200` if it is running.
To modify the startup behavior you can change the location of the Vault server using `application.properties`, for example

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    host: localhost
    port: 8200
    scheme: https
    uri: https://localhost:8200
    connection-timeout: 5000
    read-timeout: 15000
    config:
spring.config.import: vault://
----
====

* `host` sets the hostname of the Vault host.
The host name will be used for SSL certificate validation
* `port` sets the Vault port
* `scheme` setting the scheme to `http` will use plain HTTP.
Supported schemes are `http` and `https`.
* `uri` configure the Vault endpoint with an URI. Takes precedence over host/port/scheme configuration
* `connection-timeout` sets the connection timeout in milliseconds
* `read-timeout` sets the read timeout in milliseconds
* `spring.config.import` mounts Vault as `PropertySource` using all enabled secret backends (key-value enabled by default)

Enabling further integrations requires additional dependencies and configuration.
Depending on how you have set up Vault you might need additional configuration like
{docs}#vault.config.ssl[SSL] and
{docs}#vault.config.authentication[authentication].

If the application imports the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` project, the status of the vault server will be available via the `/health` endpoint.

The vault health indicator can be enabled or disabled through the property `management.health.vault.enabled` (default to `true`).

NOTE: With Spring Cloud Vault 3.0 and Spring Boot 2.4, the bootstrap context initialization (`bootstrap.yml`, `bootstrap.properties`) of property sources was deprecated.
Instead, Spring Cloud Vault favors Spring Boot's Config Data API which allows importing configuration from Vault. With Spring Boot Config Data approach, you need to set the `spring.config.import` property in order to bind to Vault. You can read more about it in the <<vault.configdata.locations, Config Data Locations section>>.
You can enable the bootstrap context either by setting the configuration property `spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled=true` or by including the dependency `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap`.

=== Authentication

Vault requires an https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/auth.html[authentication mechanism] to https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html[authorize client requests].

Spring Cloud Vault supports multiple {docs}#vault.config.authentication[authentication mechanisms] to authenticate applications with Vault.

For a quickstart, use the root token printed by the <<quickstart.vault.start,Vault initialization>>.

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76
spring.config.import: vault://
----
====

WARNING: Consider carefully your security requirements.
Static token authentication is fine if you want quickly get started with Vault, but a static token is not protected any further.
Any disclosure to unintended parties allows Vault use with the associated token roles.




== Building

=== Build requirements for Vault

Spring Cloud Vault Config requires SSL certificates and a running Vault instance listening on `localhost:8200`.
Certificates and the Vault setup are scripted, the scripts are located in `src/test/bash`.

The following scripts need to be run prior to building the project for the tests to pass.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./src/test/bash/install_vault.sh
$ ./src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh
$ ./src/test/bash/local_run_vault.sh
----

Leave Vault uninitialized, the tests will initialize and unseal Vault.
They will also create a root token `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

Changes to the documentation should be made to the adocs found under `docs/src/main/asciidoc/`

`README.adoc` can be re-generated via the following

[source,bash]
----
$ ./docs/src/main/ruby/generate_readme.sh > README.adoc
----

This script requires ruby and the asciidoctor gem installed (`gem install asciidoctor`)

:jdkversion: 17

=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ ./mvnw install
----

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.

The projects that require middleware (i.e. Redis) for testing generally
require that a local instance of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is installed and running.


=== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
https://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
https://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue as long as they use Maven 3.3.3 or better.

==== Activate the Spring Maven profile
Spring Cloud projects require the 'spring' Maven profile to be activated to resolve
the spring milestone and snapshot repositories. Use your preferred IDE to set this
profile to be active, or you may experience build errors.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

NOTE: Older versions of m2e do not support Maven 3.3, so once the
projects are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell
m2eclipse to use the right profile for the projects.  If you
see many different errors related to the POMs in the projects, check
that you have an up to date installation.  If you can't upgrade m2e,
add the "spring" profile to your `settings.xml`. Alternatively you can
copy the repository settings from the "spring" profile of the parent
pom into your `settings.xml`.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.


== Contributing

:spring-cloud-build-branch: master

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

=== Checkstyle

Spring Cloud Build comes with a set of checkstyle rules. You can find them in the `spring-cloud-build-tools` module. The most notable files under the module are:

.spring-cloud-build-tools/
----
└── src
    ├── checkstyle
    │   └── checkstyle-suppressions.xml <3>
    └── main
        └── resources
            ├── checkstyle-header.txt <2>
            └── checkstyle.xml <1>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules

==== Checkstyle configuration

Checkstyle rules are *disabled by default*. To add checkstyle to your project just define the following properties and plugins.

.pom.xml
----
<properties>
<maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnError>true</maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnError> <1>
        <maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnViolation>true
        </maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnViolation> <2>
        <maven-checkstyle-plugin.includeTestSourceDirectory>true
        </maven-checkstyle-plugin.includeTestSourceDirectory> <3>
</properties>

<build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin> <4>
                <groupId>io.spring.javaformat</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-javaformat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
            <plugin> <5>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>

    <reporting>
        <plugins>
            <plugin> <5>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </reporting>
</build>
----
<1> Fails the build upon Checkstyle errors
<2> Fails the build upon Checkstyle violations
<3> Checkstyle analyzes also the test sources
<4> Add the Spring Java Format plugin that will reformat your code to pass most of the Checkstyle formatting rules
<5> Add checkstyle plugin to your build and reporting phases

If you need to suppress some rules (e.g. line length needs to be longer), then it's enough for you to define a file under `${project.root}/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` with your suppressions. Example:

.projectRoot/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppresions.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE suppressions PUBLIC
		"-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Suppressions 1.1//EN"
		"https://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/suppressions_1_1.dtd">
<suppressions>
	<suppress files=".*ConfigServerApplication\.java" checks="HideUtilityClassConstructor"/>
	<suppress files=".*ConfigClientWatch\.java" checks="LineLengthCheck"/>
</suppressions>
----

It's advisable to copy the `${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.editorconfig` and `${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.springformat` to your project. That way, some default formatting rules will be applied. You can do so by running this script:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/.editorconfig -o .editorconfig
$ touch .springformat
```

=== IDE setup

==== Intellij IDEA

In order to setup Intellij you should import our coding conventions, inspection profiles and set up the checkstyle plugin.
The following files can be found in the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/tree/master/spring-cloud-build-tools[Spring Cloud Build] project.

.spring-cloud-build-tools/
----
└── src
    ├── checkstyle

                ├── Intellij_Project_Defaults.xml <4>
                └── Intellij_Spring_Boot_Java_Conventions.xml <5>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules
<4> Project defaults for Intellij that apply most of Checkstyle rules
<5> Project style conventions for Intellij that apply most of Checkstyle rules

.Code style

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-code-style.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Code style`. There click on the icon next to the `Scheme` section. There, click on the `Import Scheme` value and pick the `Intellij IDEA code style XML` option. Import the `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/intellij/Intellij_Spring_Boot_Java_Conventions.xml` file.

.Inspection profiles

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-inspections.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Inspections`. There click on the icon next to the `Profile` section. There, click on the `Import Profile` and import the `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/intellij/Intellij_Project_Defaults.xml` file.

.Checkstyle

To have Intellij work with Checkstyle, you have to install the `Checkstyle` plugin. It's advisable to also install the `Assertions2Assertj` to automatically convert the JUnit assertions

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-checkstyle.png[Checkstyle]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Other settings` -> `Checkstyle`. There click on the `+` icon in the `Configuration file` section. There, you'll have to define where the checkstyle rules should be picked from. In the image above, we've picked the rules from the cloned Spring Cloud Build repository. However, you can point to the Spring Cloud Build's GitHub repository (e.g. for the `checkstyle.xml` : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle.xml`). We need to provide the following variables:

- `checkstyle.header.file` - please point it to the Spring Cloud Build's, `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle-header.txt` file either in your cloned repo or via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle-header.txt` URL.
- `checkstyle.suppressions.file` - default suppressions. Please point it to the Spring Cloud Build's, `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` file either in your cloned repo or via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` URL.
- `checkstyle.additional.suppressions.file` - this variable corresponds to suppressions in your local project. E.g. you're working on `spring-cloud-contract`. Then point to the `project-root/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` folder. Example for `spring-cloud-contract` would be: `/home/username/spring-cloud-contract/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml`.

IMPORTANT: Remember to set the `Scan Scope` to `All sources` since we apply checkstyle rules for production and test sources.

=== Duplicate Finder

Spring Cloud Build brings along the  `basepom:duplicate-finder-maven-plugin`, that enables flagging duplicate and conflicting classes and resources on the java classpath.

==== Duplicate Finder configuration

Duplicate finder is *enabled by default* and will run in the `verify` phase of your Maven build, but it will only take effect in your project if you add the `duplicate-finder-maven-plugin` to the `build` section of the projecst's `pom.xml`.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.basepom.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>duplicate-finder-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

For other properties, we have set defaults as listed in the https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/wiki[plugin documentation].

You can easily override them but setting the value of the selected property prefixed with `duplicate-finder-maven-plugin`. For example, set `duplicate-finder-maven-plugin.skip` to `true` in order to skip duplicates check in your build.

If you need to add `ignoredClassPatterns` or `ignoredResourcePatterns` to your setup, make sure to add them in the plugin configuration section of your project:
