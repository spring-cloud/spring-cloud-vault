[[vault.config.authentication]]
== Authentication methods

Different organizations have different requirements for security and authentication.
Vault reflects that need by shipping multiple authentication methods.
Spring Cloud Vault supports token and AppId authentication.

[[vault.config.authentication.token]]
=== Token authentication

Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault.
Token authentication requires a static token to be provided using the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-commons.adoc#the-bootstrap-application-context[Bootstrap Application Context].
As a fallback the token may also be retrieved from ~/.vault-token which is the default location used by the Vault CLI to cache a token.

NOTE: Token authentication is the default authentication method.
If a token is disclosed an unintended party gains access to Vault and can access secrets for the intended client.

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: TOKEN
    token: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `TOKEN` selects the Token authentication method
* `token` sets the static token to use. If missing or empty, then an attempt will be made to retrieve a token from ~/.vault-token.

* https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html[Vault Documentation: Tokens]
* https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/login[Vault Documentation: CLI login]
* https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/token-helper[Vault Documentation: CLI default to ~/.vault-token]

[[vault.config.authentication.vault-agent]]
=== Vault Agent authentication

Vault ships a sidecar utility with Vault Agent since version 0.11.0. Vault Agent implements the functionality of Spring Vault's `SessionManager`
with its Auto-Auth feature.
Applications can reuse cached session credentials by relying on Vault Agent running on `localhost`.
Spring Vault can send requests without the
`X-Vault-Token` header.
Disable Spring Vault's authentication infrastructure to disable client authentication and session management.

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: NONE
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `NONE` disables `ClientAuthentication`
and `SessionManager`.

[[vault.config.authentication.appid]]
=== AppId authentication

Vault supports https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html[AppId]
authentication that consists of two hard to guess tokens.
The AppId defaults to `spring.application.name` that is statically configured.
The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the application, usually related to the runtime environment.
IP address, Mac address or a Docker container name are good examples.
Spring Cloud Vault Config supports IP address, Mac address and static UserId's (e.g. supplied via System properties).
The IP and Mac address are represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.

IP address-based UserId's use the local host's IP address.

.application.yml using SHA256 IP-Address UserId's
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:
        user-id: IP_ADDRESS
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `APPID` selects the AppId authentication method
* `app-id-path` sets the path of the AppId mount to use
* `user-id` sets the UserId method.
Possible values are `IP_ADDRESS`,
`MAC_ADDRESS` or a class name implementing a custom `AppIdUserIdMechanism`

The corresponding command to generate the IP address UserId from a command line is:

----
$ echo -n 192.168.99.1 | sha256sum
----

NOTE: Including the line break of `echo` leads to a different hash value so make sure to include the `-n` flag.

Mac address-based UserId's obtain their network device from the localhost-bound device.
The configuration also allows specifying a `network-interface` hint to pick the right device.
The value of
`network-interface` is optional and can be either an interface name or interface index (0-based).

.application.yml using SHA256 Mac-Address UserId's
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:
        user-id: MAC_ADDRESS
        network-interface: eth0
----
====

* `network-interface` sets network interface to obtain the physical address


The corresponding command to generate the IP address UserId from a command line is:

----
$ echo -n 0AFEDE1234AC | sha256sum
----

NOTE: The Mac address is specified uppercase and without colons.
Including the line break of `echo` leads to a different hash value so make sure to include the `-n` flag.

==== Custom UserId

The UserId generation is an open mechanism.
You can set
`spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id` to any string and the configured value will be used as static UserId.

A more advanced approach lets you set `spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id` to a classname.
This class must be on your classpath and must implement the `org.springframework.cloud.vault.AppIdUserIdMechanism` interface and the `createUserId` method.
Spring Cloud Vault will obtain the UserId by calling `createUserId` each time it authenticates using AppId to obtain a token.

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:
        user-id: com.examlple.MyUserIdMechanism
----
====

.MyUserIdMechanism.java
====
[source,yaml]
----
public class MyUserIdMechanism implements AppIdUserIdMechanism {

  @Override
  public String createUserId() {
    String userId = ...
    return userId;
  }
}
----
====

See also: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html[Vault Documentation: Using the App ID auth backend]

=== AppRole authentication

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html[AppRole] is intended for machine authentication, like the deprecated (since Vault 0.6.1) <<vault.config.authentication.appid>>.
AppRole authentication consists of two hard to guess (secret) tokens: RoleId and SecretId.

Spring Vault supports various AppRole scenarios (push/pull mode and wrapped).

RoleId and optionally SecretId must be provided by configuration, Spring Vault will not look up these or create a custom SecretId.

.application.yml with AppRole authentication properties
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPROLE
    app-role:
        role-id: bde2076b-cccb-3cf0-d57e-bca7b1e83a52
----
====

The following scenarios are supported along the required configuration details:

.Configuration

|===

NOTE: You can use still all combinations of push/pull/wrapped modes by providing a configured `AppRoleAuthentication` bean within the context.
Spring Cloud Vault cannot derive all possible AppRole combinations from the configuration properties.

IMPORTANT: AppRole authentication is limited to simple pull mode using reactive infrastructure.
Full pull mode is not yet supported.
Using Spring Cloud Vault with the Spring WebFlux stack enables Vault's reactive auto-configuration which can be disabled by setting `spring.cloud.vault.reactive.enabled=false`.

* `role-id` sets the RoleId.
* `secret-id` sets the SecretId.
SecretId can be omitted if AppRole is configured without requiring SecretId (See `bind_secret_id`).
* `role`: sets the AppRole name for pull mode.
* `app-role-path` sets the path of the approle authentication mount to use.

[[vault.config.authentication.awsec2]]
=== AWS-EC2 authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html[aws-ec2]
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism for AWS EC2 instances, allowing automated retrieval of a Vault token.
Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that uniquely represents each EC2 instance.

.application.yml using AWS-EC2 Authentication
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2
----
====

AWS-EC2 authentication enables nonce by default to follow the Trust On First Use (TOFU) principle.
Any unintended party that gains access to the PKCS#7 identity metadata can authenticate against Vault.

During the first login, Spring Cloud Vault generates a nonce that is stored in the auth backend aside the instance Id.
Re-authentication requires the same nonce to be sent.
Any other party does not have the nonce and can raise an alert in Vault for further investigation.

The nonce is kept in memory and is lost during application restart.
You can configure a static nonce with `spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.nonce`.

AWS-EC2 authentication roles are optional and default to the AMI.
You can configure the authentication role by setting the
`spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.role` property.

.application.yml with configured role
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2

        aws-ec2-path: aws-ec2
        identity-document: http://...
        nonce: my-static-nonce
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `AWS_EC2` selects the AWS EC2 authentication method
* `role` sets the name of the role against which the login is being attempted.
* `aws-ec2-path` sets the path of the AWS EC2 mount to use
* `identity-document` sets URL of the PKCS#7 AWS EC2 identity document
* `nonce` used for AWS-EC2 authentication.
An empty nonce defaults to nonce generation

[[vault.config.authentication.awsiam]]
=== AWS-IAM authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html[aws] backend provides a secure authentication mechanism for AWS IAM roles, allowing the automatic authentication with vault based on the current IAM role of the running application.
Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the 4 pieces of information signed by the caller with their IAM credentials to verify that the caller is indeed using that IAM role.

The current IAM role the application is running in is automatically calculated.
If you are running your application on AWS ECS then the application will use the IAM role assigned to the ECS task of the running container.
If you are running your application naked on top of an EC2 instance then the IAM role used will be the one assigned to the EC2 instance.

When using the AWS-IAM authentication you must create a role in Vault and assign it to your IAM role.
An empty `role` defaults to the friendly name the current IAM role.

.application.yml with required AWS-IAM Authentication properties
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_IAM

        aws-path: aws
        server-name: some.server.name
        endpoint-uri: https://sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
----
====

* `role` sets the name of the role against which the login is being attempted.
This should be bound to your IAM role.
If one is not supplied then the friendly name of the current IAM user will be used as the vault role.
* `aws-path` sets the path of the AWS mount to use
* `server-name` sets the value to use for the `X-Vault-AWS-IAM-Server-ID` header preventing certain types of replay attacks.
* `endpoint-uri` sets the value to use for the AWS STS API used for the `iam_request_url` parameter.

AWS-IAM requires the AWS Java SDK dependency (`com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core`) as the authentication implementation uses AWS SDK types for credentials and request signing.

[[vault.config.authentication.azuremsi]]
=== Azure MSI authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/azure.html[azure]
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism for Azure VM instances, allowing automated retrieval of a Vault token.
Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats Azure as a Trusted Third Party and uses the managed service identity and instance metadata information that can be bound to a VM instance.

.application.yml with required Azure Authentication properties

        identity-token-service: http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity…
----
====

* `role` sets the name of the role against which the login is being attempted.
* `azure-path` sets the path of the Azure mount to use
* `metadata-service` sets the URI at which to access the instance metadata service
* `identity-token-service` sets the URI at which to access the identity token service

Azure MSI authentication obtains environmental details about the virtual machine (subscription Id, resource group, VM name) from the instance metadata service.
The Vault server has Resource Id defaults to `https://vault.hashicorp.com`.
To change this, set `spring.cloud.vault.azure-msi.identity-token-service` accordingly.

[[vault.config.authentication.clientcert]]
=== TLS certificate authentication

The `cert` auth backend allows authentication using SSL/TLS client certificates that are either signed by a CA or self-signed.

To enable `cert` authentication you need to:

1. Use SSL, see <<vault.config.ssl>>
2. Configure a Java `Keystore` that contains the client certificate and the private key
3. Set the `spring.cloud.vault.authentication` to `CERT`

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: CERT
    ssl:
        key-store: classpath:keystore.jks
        key-store-password: changeit

[[vault.config.authentication.cubbyhole]]
=== Cubbyhole authentication

Cubbyhole authentication uses Vault primitives to provide a secured authentication workflow.
Cubbyhole authentication uses tokens as primary login method.
An ephemeral token is used to obtain a second, login VaultToken from Vault's Cubbyhole secret backend.
The login token is usually longer-lived and used to interact with Vault.
The login token will be retrieved from a wrapped response stored at `/cubbyhole/response`.

*Creating a wrapped token*

NOTE: Response Wrapping for token creation requires Vault 0.6.0 or higher.

[[vault.config.authentication.gcpgce]]
=== GCP-GCE authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp.html[gcp]
auth backend allows Vault login by using existing GCP (Google Cloud Platform) IAM and GCE credentials.

GCP GCE (Google Compute Engine) authentication creates a signature in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) for a service account.
A JWT for a Compute Engine instance is obtained from the GCE metadata service using https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/verifying-instance-identity[Instance identification].
This API creates a JSON Web Token that can be used to confirm the instance identity.

Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats GCP as a Trusted Third Party and uses the cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that uniquely represents each GCP service account.

[[vault.config.authentication.gcpiam]]
=== GCP-IAM authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp.html[gcp]
auth backend allows Vault login by using existing GCP (Google Cloud Platform) IAM and GCE credentials.

GCP IAM authentication creates a signature in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) for a service account.
A JWT for a service account is obtained by calling GCP IAM's https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/signJwt[`projects.serviceAccounts.signJwt`] API. The caller authenticates against GCP IAM and proves thereby its identity.
This Vault backend treats GCP as a Trusted Third Party.

IAM credentials can be obtained from either the runtime environment , specifically the https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production[`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`]
environment variable, the Google Compute metadata service, or supplied externally as e.g. JSON or base64 encoded.
JSON is the preferred form as it carries the project id and service account identifier required for calling ``projects.serviceAccounts.signJwt``.

====

* `role` sets the name of the role against which the login is being attempted.
* `credentials.location` path to the credentials resource that contains Google credentials in JSON format.
* `credentials.encoded-key` the base64 encoded contents of an OAuth2 account private key in the JSON format.
* `gcp-path` sets the path of the GCP mount to use
* `jwt-validity` configures the JWT token validity.
Defaults to 15 minutes.
* `project-id` allows overriding the project Id to a specific value.
Defaults to the project Id from the obtained credential.
* `service-account` allows overriding the service account Id to a specific value.
Defaults to the service account from the obtained credential.

GCP IAM authentication requires the Google Cloud Java SDK dependency (`com.google.apis:google-api-services-iam` and `com.google.auth:google-auth-library-oauth2-http`) as the authentication implementation uses Google APIs for credentials and JWT signing.

NOTE: Google credentials require an OAuth 2 token maintaining the token lifecycle.
All API is synchronous therefore, `GcpIamAuthentication` does not support `AuthenticationSteps` which is required for reactive usage.

[[vault.config.authentication.kubernetes]]
=== Kubernetes authentication

Kubernetes authentication mechanism (since Vault 0.8.3) allows to authenticate with Vault using a Kubernetes Service Account Token.
The authentication is role based and the role is bound to a service account name and a namespace.

A file containing a JWT token for a pod’s service account is automatically mounted at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.

[[vault.config.authentication.pcf]]
=== Pivotal CloudFoundry authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/pcf.html[pcf]
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism for applications running within Pivotal's CloudFoundry instances allowing automated retrieval of a Vault token.
Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.) as identity provisioning is handled by PCF itself.
Instead, it treats PCF as a Trusted Third Party and uses the managed instance identity.
